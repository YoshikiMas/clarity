We are organising a series of machine learning challenges to enhance hearing-aid signal processing and to better predict how people perceive speech-in-noise. For further details of the Clarity Project visit [the Clarity project website](http://claritychallenge.org/), and for details of our latest challenge visit our [challenge documentation site](https://claritychallenge.github.io/clarity_CC_doc/). You can contact the Clarity Team by email at [claritychallengecontact@gmail.com](claritychallengecontact@gmail.com).

In this repository, you will find code to support all Clarity Challenges, including baselines, toolkits, and systems from participants. **We encourage you to make your system/model open source and contribute to this repository.**
